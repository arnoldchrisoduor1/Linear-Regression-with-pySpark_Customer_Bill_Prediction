# Linear Regression Model on customer Data with pySpark and DataBricks.

- Did some light cleaning of the data on Apache Spark(pySpark).
- Uploaded the data to data bricks for distributed computing on the dataset.
- Did feature engineering on the dataset, transforming it to a form the model could train on.
- Trained the Linear regression model on the databricks cluster with 75% of the data.
- Made perdictions from the model.
- r2 was at 0.4
